## Overview

This project showcases a Small Business Cybersecurity Assessment Tool that I developed to help small businesses assess their cybersecurity practices according to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF). 

The tool allows small businesses to self-assess their cybersecurity posture, receive a maturity score, and gain insights into areas that require improvement. 

Please note that only one question per category was included to keep the assessment streamlined and accessible for small businesses who may not be familiar with the complexities of the NIST CSF. 

The project also includes a guide on interpreting the assessment results and providing recommendations aligned with the NIST CSF guidelines.

## Background

As a cybersecurity analyst and auditor, I recognized the need for a simple and accessible tool that allows small businesses to assess their cybersecurity practices effectively. Leveraging my knowledge of the NIST CSF, I developed this assessment tool with one question per category to help small businesses get a general understanding of their cybersecurity strengths and areas for improvement.
<br><br>

## Features

- Self-assessment questionnaire based on the NIST CSF core functions and categories, with one question per category for streamlined assessment.
- Scoring system to calculate the overall cybersecurity maturity score.
- Note: The tool is strictly a self-assessment in Google Sheets and does not generate tailored recommendations.
<br><br>

## Tools and Technologies

- Google Sheets
<br><br>

## How to Use

1. Access the Small Business Cybersecurity Assessment Tool via [Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TxqMqa9-W8VDfK8IWrOXqR78dre6S_UOYeDeV3d7TLw/edit?usp=sharing).
2. Complete the self-assessment questionnaire, answering one question in every category for each core function.
3. Review the assessment results, interpret the scores, and decide your next steps.

- Note: After completion, devise your risk mitigation plan with the [Small Business Risk Register and Matrix](https://github.com/cybersavvy0/small-business-cybersecurity-risk-register) tool.
<br><br>

## Assessment Creation Process

The assessment tool follows the NIST CSF, highlighting one question per category for each core function, and implementing a scoring system.
<br><br>

<br><br>

1. Step 1: Assessment Criteria
   - Add core functions and categories for assessment.
   - Create one question and scoring (low, medium, high) for each category.

2. Step 2: Design the Questionnaire
   - Organize questions under relevant core functions and categories.

3. Step 3: Calculate Maturity Score
   - Develop a formula to calculate the overall cybersecurity maturity score.

<br><br>

### Your Cybersecurity Maturity Level Score

Your overall cybersecurity maturity score, indicating the level of cybersecurity preparedness.

### Your Maturity Level Score Per Function

Individual scores for each core function, providing insights into specific areas of cybersecurity strength and improvement opportunities.

### What does my score mean?

- Score 1: Low Maturity
- Score 2: Medium Maturity
- Score 3: High Maturity

### What should I do next?

1. Review Core Functions and Categories
2. Identify Gaps and Weaknesses
3. Create a Risk Register [Access here](https://github.com/cybersavvy0/small-business-cybersecurity-risk-register)
4. Prioritize Recommendations
5. Align with NIST CSF Guidelines

5. Essential Cybersecurity Tips for Small Businesses
<br><br>

## Results Interpretation

The assessment results provide an accessible overview of the small business's cybersecurity posture. The overall maturity score indicates the level of cybersecurity preparedness. Lower scores in specific areas require attention and improvement.
<br><br>

## Future Enhancements

In the future, Iâ€™d love to enhance the assessment tool with the following features:

- Live web application using Google Cloud Functions.
- Integration with cybersecurity assessment frameworks.
- Additional assessment criteria and scoring options.
- Improved visualization of assessment results.
